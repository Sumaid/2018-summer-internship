* Introduction
  This document hols the time sheets for my work during the summer internship
  at VLEAD, IIIT Hyderabad

* Month of May
** Week 1 [2018-05-14 Tue] till [2018-05-19 Fri]
   + [2017-06-01 Thu] - Worked on centos adapter.  This is for the release of
     v1.1.0 of ADS. ADS earlier in it's first release was deployed on the base
     machine.  From v11.1.0, ADS will be deployed in seperate machine and be
     part of the cluster.  I got most of the code working, but I got stuck
     while starting the VMManager service on the newly created container.  The
     service is started, the command does nto return making the openvz-adapter
     wait forever.  I will have to figure this out.
